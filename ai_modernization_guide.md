# AI-Driven Mozilla 1.0 Codebase Modernization Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step approach for using AI to modernize the Mozilla 1.0 legacy C/C++ codebase. Each step includes specific prompts and expected outcomes to help AI assistants replicate our modernization process.

## Phase 1: Analysis and Planning

### Step 1: Initial Codebase Analysis

**Prompt:**
```
I'm working on modernizing the Mozilla 1.0 codebase (legacy C/C++). Please help me analyze this codebase by:

1. Creating a shell script that can index the codebase to gather statistics on:
   - File counts by type (.cpp, .h, .c, .idl)
   - Directory structure
   - Lines of code
   - Comment density
   - Largest files (potential complexity hotspots)
   - Module-level statistics
   - Memory management patterns
   - Error handling patterns

The script should generate a summary report with this information.
```

**Expected Outcome:** A shell script (`analysis/index_codebase.sh`) that indexes the codebase and generates statistics.

### Step 2: Detailed Pattern Analysis

**Prompt:**
```
Now I need a Python script that can analyze the Mozilla 1.0 codebase in more detail to identify modernization opportunities. The script should:

1. Detect patterns related to memory management (malloc/free, new/delete)
2. Identify error handling approaches (error codes, NS_SUCCEEDED/NS_FAILED)
3. Find C-style casts that could be replaced with safer alternatives
4. Detect manual reference counting patterns (AddRef/Release)
5. Identify out parameters that could be replaced with return values
6. Find null checks that could be replaced with Optional types
7. Generate a report of modernization opportunities by pattern and file

Please create this script and name it 'analyze_complexity.py'.
```

**Expected Outcome:** A Python script (`analysis/analyze_complexity.py`) that identifies modernization opportunities in the codebase.

### Step 3: Define Modernization KPIs

**Prompt:**
```
I need to establish Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure our progress in modernizing the Mozilla 1.0 codebase. Please create a document that defines KPIs in these categories:

1. Code Quality Metrics (cyclomatic complexity, function length, comment ratio)
2. Modernization Coverage (tracking conversion of patterns)
3. Pattern Reduction (counting reductions in problematic patterns)
4. Documentation Metrics (measuring documentation improvements)

For each KPI, include:
- A clear definition
- Measurement method
- Baseline and target values
- Measurement frequency

Name this document 'nsSelection_modernization_kpis.md'.
```

**Expected Outcome:** A document (`nsSelection_modernization_kpis.md`) defining KPIs for the modernization effort.

### Step 4: Create Modernization Templates

**Prompt:**
```
Based on our analysis, I need templates for the most common modernization patterns we've identified. Please create detailed templates for:

1. Converting error code returns to Result types
2. Replacing raw pointers with smart pointers
3. Replacing C-style casts with safer C++ casts
4. Converting out parameters to return values
5. Replacing manual reference counting with smart pointers

Each template should include:
- Before and after code examples
- Step-by-step implementation instructions
- Compatibility considerations
- Benefits of the modernization

Create these as separate markdown files in a 'modernization_templates' directory.
```

**Expected Outcome:** A set of template files in the `modernization_templates` directory for each modernization pattern.

## Phase 2: Implementation Infrastructure

### Step 5: Create KPI Measurement Tools

**Prompt:**
```
I need tools to measure our modernization KPIs. Please create:

1. A Python script (measure_modernization_kpis.py) that:
   - Analyzes C/C++ code for modernization patterns
   - Measures cyclomatic complexity
   - Calculates function lengths
   - Determines comment-to-code ratio
   - Counts occurrences of various patterns

2. A Python script (track_nsSelection_progress.py) that:
   - Tracks which methods have been modernized
   - Counts original vs. modernized pattern occurrences
   - Calculates progress percentages

3. A Python script (generate_kpi_report.py) that:
   - Creates text-based reports of KPI measurements
   - Shows progress against baseline metrics
   - Highlights modernized methods
   - Provides pattern reduction statistics

4. A shell script (update_kpis_report.sh) that:
   - Runs all measurement scripts
   - Generates timestamped reports
   - Creates symbolic links to the latest reports
```

**Expected Outcome:** A set of scripts in the `analysis` directory for measuring and reporting on modernization KPIs.

### Step 6: Establish Baseline Measurements

**Prompt:**
```
Let's establish baseline measurements for our modernization KPIs. Please:

1. Run the KPI measurement scripts on the nsSelection.cpp file
2. Generate a baseline report
3. Save the baseline measurements for future comparison
4. Update our documentation with the baseline values
```

**Expected Outcome:** Baseline measurements for nsSelection.cpp and an initial KPI report.

## Phase 3: Pilot Implementation

### Step 7: Select Pilot File

**Prompt:**
```
Based on our analysis, nsSelection.cpp appears to be a good candidate for our pilot modernization. Please:

1. Analyze nsSelection.cpp in detail
2. Identify the most common modernization opportunities in this file
3. Create a plan for modernizing this file
4. Prioritize which methods to modernize first
```

**Expected Outcome:** A detailed analysis of nsSelection.cpp and a modernization plan.

### Step 8: Implement First Modernized Method

**Prompt:**
```
Let's start by modernizing the GetRangeAt method in nsSelection.cpp. Please:

1. Create a modernized version that:
   - Uses Result<T> instead of error codes
   - Uses smart pointers instead of raw pointers
   - Uses safe casts instead of C-style casts
   - Follows modern C++ best practices

2. Create a compatibility wrapper that maintains the original API

3. Document the changes and the modernization patterns applied
```

**Expected Outcome:** A modernized implementation of the GetRangeAt method with a compatibility wrapper.

### Step 9: Implement Additional Methods

**Prompt:**
```
Let's continue modernizing nsSelection.cpp by implementing these additional methods:

1. GetPresContext
2. AddItem
3. RemoveItem
4. Clear

For each method:
- Apply the appropriate modernization templates
- Create compatibility wrappers
- Document the changes
```

**Expected Outcome:** Modernized implementations of additional methods with compatibility wrappers.

### Step 10: Measure Progress

1. Update the measure_modernization_kpis.py script to:
   - Count documentation files and lines
   - Track modernization documentation
   - Measure template documentation

2. Update the generate_kpi_report.py script to include documentation metrics in the reports

3. Update the update_kpis_report.sh script to include the new metrics
```

**Expected Outcome:** Enhanced KPI measurement infrastructure that includes documentation metrics.

### Step 14: Update Documentation

**Prompt:**
```
Let's update our modernization process documentation to reflect our progress and lessons learned:

1. Update the modernization_process_documentation.md file to:
   - Document our implementation approach
   - Include lessons learned from the pilot implementation
   - Reflect the current state of the project
   - Outline next steps
```

**Expected Outcome:** Updated documentation reflecting the current state of the project.

## Complete Implementation Example

To demonstrate the full modernization process, here's an example of modernizing the GetRangeAt method in nsSelection.cpp:

### Original Implementation:
```cpp
NS_IMETHODIMP
nsSelection::GetRangeAt(PRInt32 aIndex, nsIDOMRange** aReturn)
{
  if (!aReturn)
    return NS_ERROR_NULL_POINTER;
  *aReturn = nsnull;
  
  nsresult res = NS_OK;
  if (aIndex < 0 || aIndex >= (PRInt32)mRanges.Length())
    return NS_ERROR_INVALID_ARG;
  
  if (mRanges[aIndex]) {
    res = CallQueryInterface(mRanges[aIndex], aReturn);
  }
  
  return res;
}
```

### Modernized Implementation:
```cpp
Result<nsCOMPtr<nsIDOMRange>, nsresult>
nsSelection::GetRangeAtModern(int32_t aIndex)
{
  if (aIndex < 0 || aIndex >= static_cast<int32_t>(mRanges.Length())) {
    return Err(NS_ERROR_INVALID_ARG);
  }
  
  if (!mRanges[aIndex]) {
    return Ok(nullptr);
  }
  
  nsCOMPtr<nsIDOMRange> range = do_QueryInterface(mRanges[aIndex]);
  return Ok(range);
}

// Compatibility wrapper
NS_IMETHODIMP
nsSelection::GetRangeAt(int32_t aIndex, nsIDOMRange** aReturn)
{
  if (!aReturn) {
    return NS_ERROR_NULL_POINTER;
  }
  *aReturn = nullptr;
  
  auto result = GetRangeAtModern(aIndex);
  if (result.isErr()) {
    return result.unwrapErr();
  }
  
  nsCOMPtr<nsIDOMRange> range = result.unwrap();
  range.forget(aReturn);
  return NS_OK;
}
```

This example demonstrates several modernization patterns:
1. Using Result<T> instead of error codes
2. Using smart pointers instead of raw pointers
3. Using static_cast instead of C-style casts
4. Providing a compatibility wrapper for backward compatibility
