# Mozilla 1.0 Modernization KPI Measurement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for measuring the success of our modernization efforts on the Mozilla 1.0 codebase, with a specific focus on nsSelection.cpp as our pilot file.

## Key Performance Indicators

### 1. Code Quality Metrics

| Metric | Measurement Method | Baseline | Target | Measurement Frequency |
|--------|-------------------|---------|--------|----------------------|
| Cyclomatic Complexity | Static analysis tool | TBD | 20% reduction | After each major milestone |
| Function Length | Line count | TBD | 25% reduction | After each major milestone |
| Comment-to-Code Ratio | Static analysis tool | TBD | 15% increase | After each major milestone |
| Code Duplication | Static analysis tool | TBD | 30% reduction | After each major milestone |

### 2. Modernization Coverage

| Metric | Measurement Method | Baseline | Target | Measurement Frequency |
|--------|-------------------|---------|--------|----------------------|
| Manual Reference Counting → Smart Pointers | Count of conversions | 0% | 100% | Weekly |
| Error Code Returns → Result Types | Count of conversions | 0% | 100% | Weekly |
| C-style Casts → Safe Casts | Count of conversions | 0% | 100% | Weekly |
| Out Parameters → Return Values | Count of conversions | 0% | 100% | Weekly |
| Null Checks → Optional Types | Count of conversions | 0% | 100% | Weekly |

### 3. Performance Metrics

| Metric | Measurement Method | Baseline | Target | Measurement Frequency |
|--------|-------------------|---------|--------|----------------------|
| Memory Usage | Memory profiler | TBD | 10% reduction | After each major milestone |
| CPU Usage | Performance profiler | TBD | 5% improvement | After each major milestone |
| Startup Time | Timed execution | TBD | 5% improvement | After each major milestone |
| Selection Operation Speed | Benchmark tests | TBD | 10% improvement | After each major milestone |

### 4. Reliability Metrics

| Metric | Measurement Method | Baseline | Target | Measurement Frequency |
|--------|-------------------|---------|--------|----------------------|
| Test Coverage | Code coverage tool | TBD | 90% | After each major milestone |
| Bug Count | Bug tracking system | TBD | 30% reduction | Monthly |
| Crash Rate | Crash reporting | TBD | 50% reduction | Monthly |
| Memory Leaks | Memory profiler | TBD | 90% reduction | After each major milestone |

### 5. Developer Experience Metrics

| Metric | Measurement Method | Baseline | Target | Measurement Frequency |
|--------|-------------------|---------|--------|----------------------|
| Code Readability | Developer survey | TBD | 8/10 rating | Quarterly |
| Maintainability | Time to implement new features | TBD | 30% reduction | Quarterly |
| Onboarding Time | Time for new developers to make contributions | TBD | 40% reduction | Quarterly |
| Documentation Quality | Developer survey | TBD | 8/10 rating | Quarterly |

## Measurement Timeline

1. **Baseline Measurement (Immediate)**
   - Establish baseline metrics for all KPIs
   - Document current state of nsSelection.cpp

2. **Weekly Measurements**
   - Track modernization coverage metrics
   - Report progress to the team

3. **Monthly Measurements**
   - Track bug count and crash rate
   - Assess progress against targets

4. **Quarterly Measurements**
   - Conduct developer surveys
   - Measure developer experience metrics
   - Comprehensive review of all KPIs

5. **Major Milestone Measurements**
   - Complete code quality analysis
   - Performance and reliability testing
   - Update targets based on results

## Reporting

We will create a dashboard to visualize our progress against these KPIs. The dashboard will be updated according to the measurement frequency for each metric and will be accessible to all team members.

## Next Steps

1. Set up the necessary tools for measuring each KPI
2. Establish baseline measurements for nsSelection.cpp
3. Begin regular tracking according to the measurement timeline
4. Adjust modernization approach based on KPI results
