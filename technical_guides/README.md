# Mozilla 1.0 Modernization Technical Guides

This directory contains comprehensive technical guides for modernizing the Mozilla 1.0 codebase. These guides provide detailed explanations, examples, and best practices for applying modern C++ patterns to legacy code.

## Available Guides

### Core Modernization Patterns

1. [**Result Pattern Guide**](result_pattern_guide.md)
   - Converting error code returns to Result<T> types
   - Explicit error handling with monadic operations
   - Compatibility with existing code

2. [**Smart Pointer Guide**](smart_pointer_guide.md)
   - Using nsCOMPtr, nsAutoPtr, and nsRefPtr
   - Converting manual memory management to automatic
   - Ownership transfer and lifetime management

3. [**Safe Casting Guide**](safe_casting_guide.md)
   - Replacing C-style casts with static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast, and reinterpret_cast
   - When to use each casting operator
   - Performance considerations

4. [**Maybe Type Guide**](maybe_type_guide.md)
   - Using Maybe<T> for optional values
   - Replacing null checks with type-safe alternatives
   - Combining Maybe<T> with Result<T>

## How to Use These Guides

These guides are designed to be used as reference material when modernizing code in the Mozilla 1.0 codebase. They provide:

1. **Background Information**: Understanding the legacy patterns and their drawbacks
2. **Modern Alternatives**: Detailed explanations of modern C++ patterns
3. **Step-by-Step Instructions**: How to convert legacy code to modern patterns
4. **Examples**: Real-world examples from the Mozilla 1.0 codebase
5. **Best Practices**: Guidelines for applying modernization patterns effectively

## Contributing

To contribute to these guides:

1. Identify areas that need more detailed explanation
2. Create new guides for additional modernization patterns
3. Improve existing guides with more examples or clearer explanations
4. Update guides based on lessons learned during modernization

## Future Guides

We plan to add the following guides in the future:

1. **Modern Error Handling Guide**: Beyond Result<T> to comprehensive error handling
2. **RAII Pattern Guide**: Resource management with constructors and destructors
3. **Modern Iteration Guide**: Using iterators and range-based loops
4. **Template Metaprogramming Guide**: Using templates for compile-time safety and optimization
