# Documentation Metrics Guide

This document explains the documentation metrics tracked in our Mozilla 1.0 Modernization KPI reports.

## Documentation Metrics Explained

### 1. Total Documentation Files
All markdown (.md) files in the project that provide any form of documentation, including guides, reports, and analysis documents.

### 2. Total Documentation Lines
The total number of lines across all documentation files.

### 3. Modernization Documentation Files
Files specifically focused on modernization aspects, identified by having "modernization_" or "modernized_" in their filename. These include modernization plans, progress reports, and implementation guides.

### 4. Modernization Documentation Lines
The total number of lines in modernization-specific documentation.

### 5. Template Documentation Files
Files in the "modernization_templates/" directory that describe specific modernization patterns in detail. Each template provides a step-by-step guide for converting a specific legacy pattern to its modern equivalent.

### 6. Template Documentation Lines
The total number of lines in template documentation files.

### 7. Code Documentation Files
Source code files (primarily .cpp and .h files) that contain significant documentation in the form of detailed comments, function documentation, and implementation notes.

### 8. Code Documentation Lines
The total number of lines of documentation comments within source code files, including both block comments (/* */) and line comments (//).

## Importance of Documentation Metrics

These metrics help us track our documentation coverage and ensure that we're properly documenting our modernization efforts at all levels - from high-level plans to specific implementation details in the code itself.

Good documentation is essential for:

1. **Knowledge Transfer**: Ensuring that the modernization approach can be understood and applied by other developers
2. **Consistency**: Maintaining a consistent approach to modernization across the codebase
3. **Maintainability**: Making the modernized code easier to maintain in the future
4. **Learning**: Providing educational resources for developers new to modern C++ patterns

## How Documentation Metrics Are Measured

Documentation metrics are measured using automated scripts that:

1. Count all markdown files in the project
2. Categorize them based on naming conventions and location
3. Count the lines in each file
4. For code documentation, identify and count comment blocks in source files

These measurements are performed each time a KPI report is generated, providing up-to-date metrics on our documentation progress.
